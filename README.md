# Ratune

A terminal music player for Subsonic-compatible servers.
Built in Rust with [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui), featuring album art graphics (including in tmux), gapless playback, internet radio, fuzzy finder support, and a highly configurable UI.

**Why Ratune?**

Ratune was built to bring together a combination of features often missing from Subsonic players: fuzzy navigation, a visually rich UI with album art, deep customization, and a fully terminal-based workflow. Many players excel at a few of these. Ratune aims to cover them all.

## Highlights

- **Playback**: Gapless queue, seek, shuffle/unshuffle, and playlist management.
- **Internet radio**: Stations from your server
- **Album Art**: Display using Kitty graphics and [ratatui-image](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui-image) (see link for compatible terminals)
- **Lyrics**: Synced lyrics via LRCLib (default), NetEase Cloud Music, or your Subsonic server. Optional on-disk cache for offline use
- **Offline mode**: Starts without a server when needed; plays cached tracks, browse from library index, and detects reconnect automatically
- **Visualizer**: FFT spectrum analyzer.
- **Fuzzy finder**: Optional library index + external picker (fzf/skim) for fast track selection.
- **Folder navigation**: Optional Browse layout that follows server music folders for servers that provide it.
- **Customization**: Keybinds, theme, layout, now-playing lines, queue row template inspired by ncmpcpp.
- **Mouse support**: Click tabs, transport controls, the seek bar, queue rows, and browse/home lists.
- **Integration**: Linux MPRIS (media keys, `playerctl`).
- **Scrobbling**: Last.fm and Libre.fm (Audioscrobbler), plus optional Subsonic `/scrobble` for Navidrome play counts.

---

## Requirements

### Runtime (prebuilt binary or any install)

These apply whenever you run Ratune, including [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/acmagn/ratune/releases) assets.

- **Server**: A Subsonic-compatible music server (Navidrome is a good default).
- **Linux audio**: ALSA userspace library at runtime — e.g. Debian/Ubuntu `libasound2`, Fedora `alsa-lib`, Arch `alsa-lib`. (You do **not** need `-dev` / `*-devel` packages just to run a prebuilt binary.)
- **Linux D-Bus**: `libdbus-1` at runtime — e.g. Debian/Ubuntu `libdbus-1-3`, Fedora `dbus-libs`, Arch `dbus`. Required by the Linux binary (scrobble keyring, etc.); usually already installed on desktop Linux.
- **macOS audio**: Uses Core Audio via the system toolchain; no separate audio library install for typical use.
- **Optional**: `fzf` or `sk` on `PATH` if you use the library fuzzy picker (see `[library]` in the sample config).

Prebuilt archives on [Releases](https://github.com/acmagn/ratune/releases): **Linux x86_64** (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`), **macOS Apple Silicon** (`aarch64-apple-darwin`), and **macOS Intel** (`x86_64-apple-darwin`). Other targets need a local build (or your own packaging).

### Build from source

Everything under **Runtime**, plus:

- **Rust**: Stable toolchain (`rustup` default stable is fine).
- **Linux build deps**: ALSA and D-Bus headers plus `pkg-config` — e.g. Debian/Ubuntu `libasound2-dev` + `libdbus-1-dev` + `pkg-config`, Fedora `alsa-lib-devel` + `dbus-devel`, Arch `alsa-lib` + `dbus`.

---

## Installation

Current options are:

[Binaries](#binary-releases-linux-x86_64-macos)
[AUR](#arch-linux-aur)
[crates.io](#cratesio)
[Homebrew](#macos-homebrew)
[Nix](#nix)
[From source](#build-from-source-1).


### Binary Releases (Linux x86_64, macOS)

Download the `.tar.gz` for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/acmagn/ratune/releases).
Extract and put `ratune` on your `PATH`.

### Arch Linux (AUR)

Install the **`-bin`** package with an AUR helper, e.g.:

```bash
yay -S ratune-bin
# or: paru -S ratune-bin
```

[ratune-bin on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ratune-bin) ships the same Linux binary as GitHub Releases.

### crates.io

```sh
cargo install ratune
```

This **builds** from the published crate. You need a **Rust toolchain**; on **Linux**, install ALSA and D-Bus **development** packages first (same as [Build from source](#build-from-source)).

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew tap acmagn/ratune
brew trust --formula acmagn/ratune/ratune
brew install ratune
```

### Nix

```sh
nix profile install github:acmagn/ratune
```

That puts `ratune` on your `PATH`. To try it without installing: `nix run github:acmagn/ratune`.

Home Manager (package only; config stays at `~/.config/ratune/config.toml`):

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.ratune.homeManagerModules.default ];
  programs.ratune.enable = true;
}
```

### Build from source

Use this when you want the latest git checkout, you’re on an OS/arch without a prebuilt, or you’re developing Ratune.

**Linux:** install ALSA and D-Bus headers and `pkg-config` *before* the first build:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libdbus-1-dev pkg-config

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel dbus-devel pkg-config

# Arch
sudo pacman -S alsa-lib dbus
```

**Clone and build:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/acmagn/ratune.git
cd ratune
cargo build --release
```

The binary is `target/release/ratune`. Check the build with `ratune --version` (or `-V`).

For development, run `cargo test --workspace --locked`. Synthetic API fixtures
are checked with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_*.py'`.
After `cargo build --locked -p ratune`, `python3 tools/tui_smoke.py` tests the TUI
using a private tmux server, temporary settings and silent synthetic audio;
it requires tmux and Python 3, but no real server or credentials.

**Git hooks (optional):** [Lefthook](https://lefthook.dev/install/) runs `cargo fmt` before each commit when Rust files are staged. Install lefthook once (e.g. Arch: `pacman -S lefthook`, Homebrew: `brew install lefthook`, or a [standalone binary](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/releases)), then from the repo root:

```sh
lefthook install
```

**Album art in the terminal:** from a source checkout you can run a small [ratatui-image](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui-image) harness (same capability query as the real UI) to verify your terminal or tmux passthrough. Use any JPEG/PNG (etc.) on disk:

```sh
# Cargo workspace root (this repo layout)
cargo run -p ratune --example art_image_test -- /path/to/cover.jpg

# Or from the ratune/ crate directory only
cargo run --example art_image_test -- /path/to/cover.jpg
```

Press `q` or Esc to exit.

---

## Configuration

On first start, ratune creates a short default file at `~/.config/ratune/config.toml` (server fields plus common UI defaults). For every key with comments, use the sample file and copy the sections you need: [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml).

### Connecting

Set Subsonic **url** and **username**, then choose how to supply the secret (most secure first):

1. **OS keyring (default)** — leave `password = ""` or remove field entirely. On Linux choose the backend with `password_keyring` (see below).
2. **`password_command`** — run a shell command; stdout is the secret (e.g. `secret-tool`, `pass`, KeePassXC CLI).
3. **Plaintext** — `password = "..."` in the file, or env vars (convenient for scripts; avoid in shared configs).

#### Keyring

Leave `password` empty. Ratune uses [`keyring-core`](https://crates.io/crates/keyring-core) with a platform store: on Linux you pick **`keyutils`** (kernel keyring, default) or **`secret-service`** (gnome-keyring / KWallet); **Keychain** on macOS; **Credential Manager** on Windows. On first run you are prompted once ([inquire](https://crates.io/crates/inquire)); the secret is stored under service **`ratune`** and user **`{url}|{username}`** — not in `config.toml`.

- **`password_keyring = "keyutils"`** (default) — [kernel keyutils](https://docs.rs/linux-keyutils-keyring-store/latest/linux_keyutils_keyring_store/). Lightweight and fine for a server password you can re-enter after reboot; keys may not survive reboot ([persistence](https://docs.rs/linux-keyutils-keyring-store/latest/linux_keyutils_keyring_store/#persistence)).
- **`password_keyring = "secret-service"`** — [Secret Service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/) via libsecret (same wallet as `secret-tool`, browser password managers, etc.). Better when you want the password to persist across reboots like other desktop secrets.

If the chosen store is unavailable (e.g. headless container) you get a one-time session prompt, use **`password_command`** or **`SUBSONIC_PASS`** instead.

```toml
[server]
url = "https://your-navidrome.example.com"
username = "you"
password = "" # or remove entirely
# password_keyring = "keyutils"       # default on Linux
# password_keyring = "secret-service" # gnome-keyring / KWallet
```

#### External secret store (`password_command`)

When you already use a wallet (e.g. `secret-tool`, `pass`, KeePassXC):

```toml
[server]
url = "https://your-navidrome.example.com"
username = "you"
password_command = "secret-tool lookup --label=ratune service subsonic user you"
```

The command runs under `/bin/sh -c` on Unix (or `cmd /C` on Windows); only trimmed stdout is used. Plaintext `password` or `SUBSONIC_PASS` take precedence if set.

#### Plaintext

```toml
password = "your_password"
```

Subsonic auth uses a random salt per request and `MD5(secret + salt)` ([Navidrome / Subsonic API](https://www.navidrome.org/docs/developers/subsonic-api/)).

### Environment overrides (optional)

Overrides the config file when set:

```sh
export SUBSONIC_URL="https://your-server.example.com"
export SUBSONIC_USER="admin"
export SUBSONIC_PASS="your_password"
```

`TERMUSIC_SUBSONIC_*` variants are also accepted (see sample config).

### Snippets: player, cache, theme, fzf

```toml
[player]
default_volume = 70
max_bit_rate = 0
queue_loop = true

[cache]
enabled = true
max_size_gb = 2
# cache_starred = false         # prefetch favorite tracks while online (Subsonic star API); default: false
# cache_starred_parallelism = 2 # concurrent favorite-track downloads when cache_starred is true

[ui]
# Only `album_art_backend` lives here; NP strip/queue/toggles → `[ui.nptab]`, `[ui.row_now_playing]`, …

[theme]
preset = "dynamic"

[library]
# enabled, index path, fzf binary, fzf args, …  → see sample-config.toml

[radio]
enabled = true
# fetch_station_icons = true   # homepage favicons when no server logo
```

Remapping is done in `[keybinds]`; colors in `[theme]`; now-playing strip vs queue are different keys — see the sample and in-app help (`i`).

### Favorites

Ratune syncs favorites with your server through the Subsonic **star** / **unstar** / **getStarred2** API. Favorited items show a **★** in browse lists and the Now Playing queue.

- **Toggle favorite:** `f` on the focused song, album, artist, or queue row (`toggle_favorite` in `[keybinds]`)
- **Browse favorites:** `F` on the Browse tab — songs, albums, and artists from `getStarred2`
- **Queue from favorites:** same keys as Browse (`Enter` to play, `a` / `A` to append, etc.)
- **Albums and artists** can be favorited too (Navidrome supports all three via the star API)
- **Offline:** the favorites list is cached at `~/.cache/ratune/favorites.json`; open `F` without a connection to browse the last sync and play tracks already in the audio cache
- **`[cache].cache_starred = true`:** while online, prefetch favorite **songs** into the offline cache (same `max_size_gb` pool as play-time caching)

### Ratings

Ratune can sync per-user song ratings with your server through the Subsonic **`setRating`** API (1–5 stars, or 0 to clear). **Ratings are off by default**, enable them in config if you want the UI, keybinds, and MPRIS export.

```toml
[ratings]
enabled = true
# star_filled = "★"
# star_empty = "☆"
# Optional: change or remove brackets around the rating ("" = none)
# bracket_open = "["
# bracket_close = "]"
```

When enabled, press **Shift+1** … **Shift+5** to rate (most US terminals deliver these as `!` `@` `#` `$` `%`; Shift+0 / `)` clears).

- **Display:** rated items show `[⭑⭑⭑⭒⭒]` via `{rating}` in the queue template (after duration by default). Browse lists append the rating after the title.
- **Rate:** `Shift+1` … `Shift+5` on the focused song, album, or artist (`rate_song_1` … in `[keybinds]`)
- **Clear rating:** `Shift+0` / `)` (`rate_song_clear`)
- **MPRIS (Linux):** current track rating as `xesam:userRating` (0.0–1.0)
- Requires an online server connection (like favorites)

Unrated tracks show nothing until you rate them.

### Internet radio

Ratune plays internet radio stations configured on your Subsonic-compatible server — no separate stream proxy; the client connects directly to each station URL.

- **Enable / disable:** `[radio] enabled = true` (default) in [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml); set `false` to disable radio entirely
- **Station picker:** default keybinding **`Shift+R`** to browse, play, add, edit, and delete stations (`toggle_radio` in `[keybinds]`)
- **Live playback:** progress shows **● LIVE** and elapsed listen time; **n** / **N** change stations while tuned in
- **Formats:** direct Icecast/SHOUTcast URLs (MP3, AAC, and Ogg Vorbis).
- **Station art:** Navidrome-uploaded logos, or optional homepage favicon fetch (`[radio] fetch_station_icons`)

### Folder navigation (Browse)

When enabled, the Browse tab can switch between the usual artist / album / track columns and a folder layout that mirrors how your server organizes files on disk (or per-library roots). This uses the Subsonic APIs `getMusicFolders`, `getIndexes`, and `getMusicDirectory` (tested with Navidrome and [gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic)).

**Enable in config** (`[ui.browsetab]` in [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml)):

```toml
[ui.browsetab]
folder_navigation = true
# mode = "artists"   # default on startup (default)
# mode = "files"     # start in folder view when folder_navigation is true
```

**Toggle at runtime:** default **`Ctrl+b`** (`toggle_folder_browse` in `[keybinds]`). Switches between folder view and artist browsing and jumps to the Browse tab. If you start in `files` mode, the first toggle to artists loads the artist list if it was not fetched yet.

### Scrobbling

Ratune can scrobble listens to Last.fm or Libre.fm and optionally notify your Subsonic server so Navidrome records play counts. 

Full reference: [`[scrobble]`](docs/sample-config.toml) in the sample config.

#### Enable

Register an API account at [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) (or Libre.fm equivalent), then add a `[scrobble]` block. 

```toml
[scrobble]
enabled = true
service = "lastfm"   # or "librefm"
api_key = "your_application_key"
scrobble_to_server = true   # Subsonic /scrobble (default: true; works without Last.fm)
```

Same options for secret handling as Subsonic password are provided.

#### keyring or secret commands

To not store secrets in the file (synced dotfiles, shared machines, etc.), leave `api_secret` / `session_key` empty and use either command in config or ratune functions to save to the keyring.


| Secret | Resolution order |
|--------|------------------|
| `api_secret` | config → `api_secret_command` → OS keyring (`lastfm\|api_secret`) |
| `session_key` | config → `session_key_command` → OS keyring (`lastfm\|session`) |

Keyring entries use service `ratune`. On Linux, scrobble secrets always use Secret Service (gnome-keyring / KWallet). Env vars (`LASTFM_API_SECRET`, `LASTFM_SESSION_KEY`, …) override the file, same as Subsonic.

```sh
ratune scrobble-api-secret --save-keyring
ratune scrobble-auth --save-keyring
```

Without `--save-keyring`, each command prints the value to paste into config instead.

If you previously saved scrobble secrets with an older build (kernel keyutils), re-run the commands above once and they will land in your desktop wallet instead.

#### plaintext

You can optionally store either/both of these as plaintext instead.

```toml
[scrobble]
enabled = true
service = "lastfm"   # or "librefm"
api_key = "your_application_key"
api_secret = "your_shared_secret"
session_key = "your_session_key"   # from `ratune scrobble-auth`
scrobble_to_server = true   # Subsonic /scrobble (default: true; works without Last.fm)
```

Get `session_key` once with `ratune scrobble-auth` (prints the key for config unless you pass `--save-keyring`).

#### Behaviour

- **Now playing** is sent when a track starts.
- **Scrobble** fires at min(`min_percent`% of track length, `max_listen_seconds`). Defaults for Last.fm: 50%, 4 minutes. Tracks ≤ `min_track_seconds` (default 30 s) are skipped.
- **Subsonic scrobble** (if enabled) uses a separate local threshold (default: 50%, 30 s cap).
- Both sets of thresholds are optional under `[scrobble.thresholds.local]` and `[scrobble.thresholds.audioscrobbler]` — see the sample config. Audioscrobbler defaults follow [Last.fm’s scrobbling rules](https://www.last.fm/api/scrobbling); deviating may cause ignored scrobbles.
- Failed Last.fm submissions are queued in `~/.local/share/ratune/scrobble-queue.json` and retried on the next launch (entries older than 14 days are dropped).
- The status bar shows the service name when scrobbling is enabled; a **✓** appears briefly after a successful submit. Pending queue items show as `Last.fm (N)`.

## Default keybinds

Browse (`2`) shows an artist list and album gallery. Use `Enter` to open albums and tracks, `h/l` to move between album cards, `j/k` to move by row, and `Esc` to go back without losing the album selection. `a` appends the selected album; `Ctrl+r` replaces the queue and plays it. Cover thumbnails currently use iTerm2-compatible terminals; other backends show placeholders. Folder browsing keeps its existing layout. The gallery regression scenario is `python3 tools/tui_smoke.py --scenario gallery`.

Instant Mix (`m`) replaces the queue with the selected track and similar songs returned by the server's `getSimilarSongs2` API. Select a track in Browse or Now Playing; on Home, the playing track is used. Press `m` again to cancel. Empty results, errors, and responses received after playback or the queue changes leave the queue untouched. Configure `[keybinds] instant_mix` to rebind it, or set it to `""` to disable it. Recommendation quality and song-seed support depend on the server.

The synthetic end-to-end check is `python3 tools/tui_smoke.py --scenario mix` after building.

These are defaults; everything is overridable in `config.toml`. Press `i` in the app for the list that matches your file.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Home / Browse / Now playing |
| `Tab` | Next tab (wrap) |
| `j` / `k` | Move selection |
| `h` / `l` | Columns / home album strip |
| `Enter` | Open / play |
| `a` / `A` | Add track / add all |
| `Ctrl+r` | Replace queue |
| `p` / `Space` | Play / pause |
| `n` / `N` | Next / previous |
| `f` / `F` | Toggle favorite / toggle favorites panel (Browse) |
| `x` / `z` | Shuffle / unshuffle |
| `Q` | Toggle queue loop |
| `m` | Instant Mix / cancel pending mix |
| `Shift+R` | Internet radio station picker |
| `Ctrl+g` | Now Playing: radio pane ↔ library queue |
| `+` / `-` | Volume |
| `←` / `→` | Seek (Now playing) |
| `/` | Search |
| `L` | Lyrics |
| `V` | Visualizer |
| `P` | Playlist overlay (Browse): `r` rename, `c` create, `X` delete |
| `>` | Add to playlist (Browse) |
| `Ctrl+f` | Library fzf picker (if configured) |
| `Ctrl+b` | Toggle folder / artist browse (if `[ui.browsetab] folder_navigation = true`) |
| `t` | Toggle dynamic theme |
| `i` | Help |
| `q` | Quit |

## Mouse support

Ratune captures pointer input when your terminal supports it. Keyboard navigation remains fully available; mouse clicks dispatch the same actions as the equivalent keys where that makes sense.

| Area | Click |
| --- | --- |
| Tab bar | Switch Home / Browse / Now playing |
| Transport row | Shuffle (`⇄`), previous, play/pause, next, queue loop (`↻`) |
| Progress bar | Seek to position |
| Browse | Select artist, album, or track; folder mode: directory or preview row |
| Home | Recent albums (including art strip), recent tracks, rediscover rows |
| Now playing | Queue row to select; double-click same row to play; radio pane row to select station |

Scroll the mouse wheel over Browse lists to move the selection (`[ui.browsetab] mouse_wheel_scroll_lines` in the sample config).

### Fuzzy finder

Full-library fzf (or sk) flow.

**Library metadata required for fuzzy finding to work properly.** Enable it and configure refresh/arguments under `[library]` in [`docs/sample-config.toml`](docs/sample-config.toml). Ratune will then fill the library metadata. It can take a few minutes and fuzzy finding will be unavailble during that time, please be patient!

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/fzf.png" alt="Fuzzy library picker" width="90%" />
</p>

### Customization

Theme, layout, now-playing lines, queue row template, tab bar, and more are configured in `config.toml` (see the sample config).


<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/customization.png" alt="UI customization" width="90%" />
</p>

Colors can be based on terminal/os, dynamic based on the album art, or override to whatever you prefer. Transparency for background is also supported.
